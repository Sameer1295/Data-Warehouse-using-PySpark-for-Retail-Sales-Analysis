# Data Warehouse using PySpark for Retail Sales Analysis

This project focuses on building a data warehouse solution for retail sales analysis using PySpark, Delta Lake, and AWS Athena. It involves ETL processes to ingest sales, customers, and product data from S3, transform it using PySpark scripts, and store it in staging, landing, and final dimension and fact tables. The data is then queried using Athena to provide insights into customer sales orders and other key metrics.
